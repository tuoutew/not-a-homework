        <p><b>"ashamed"</b></p>
        <p>I think that any story is unique. It can be an ashaming moment for someone, but brings inspiration and motivation for others. As for me, it's beautiful. I adore people who can make fun of themselves and bring joy into our boring grey days.</p>

        <p><b>"bawl your eyes"</b></p>
        <p>Here we can see a meme version of the famous "What hurts you today, makes you stronger tomorrow." You see, being sad and getting back stronger in our culture like butter and bread, bacon and eggs, fish and chips (wow, what diet does to people)...it's inseparable</p>

        <p><b>"devastation"</b></p>
        <p>Now this is a harsh truth of the last years. My advice is simple since we can't do anything with most of the situations around us, we must just face it and admit that this exists. What next? Well, nothing. It's bad and it exists, jackpot! So why wouldn't we have fun and try our best to enjoy things that we still have and try to change something we can? </p>

        <p><b>"total fool"</b></p>
        <p>In this crazy world, we all have moments when we'd rather dodge those pesky questions (or they will just get mad). The secret? Be a total fool! It's not as absurd as it sounds – a sprinkle of silliness can work wonders. Instead of dreading inquiries, use humor to deflect them. From wacky dance moves to nonsensical jokes, your foolery will leave people confused and forgetting what they were going to ask. So, why not take a dip in the pool of absurdity? Being a total fool can be the most fun and effective way to ensure nobody bothers you with those boring questions. </p>

        <p><b>"believe in luck"</b></p>
        <p>Believing in hard work rather than luck is a principle that holds true for achieving success. Luck is unpredictable, while hard work is a consistent and reliable path to success. When we put in the effort and dedication, we increase our chances of achieving our goals. Hard work allows us to take control of our destiny and build a better future. In the end, it is the sweat, determination, and persistence that lead to lasting success, not just relying on luck.</p>

        <p><b>"inspiration"</b></p>
        <p>Inspiration, that magical spark that lights up our creative engines, is like a burst of confetti at a party – it's what makes life more colorful and fun. It's way cooler than influence because it's like a personal superhero costume, custom-made just for you. Influence is like a borrowed cape, but inspiration? It's the real deal, and it makes you the star of your show. </p>
